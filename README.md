What I Learned
-----

Transforms, transitions, keyframes, responsive images, media queries, gradients! Lots of stuff to soak in for this project. I learned that there's a bit of a debate whether to design for mobiles first or second, and decided to agree with the mobile-first crowd. I still struggle a bit now and then to get the placement of stuff correctly with flexbox/grid, but I'm steadly improving. 

Also, no frameworks were used in this project.
